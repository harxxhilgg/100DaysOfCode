## Day - 09

Today, I Solved 2 JavaScript DSA Questions on LeetCode.

Problem 1: Return Length of Arguments Passed
Problem Statement: Write a function argumentsLength that returns the count of arguments passed to it.

Problem 2: Allow One Function Call
Problem Statement: Given a function `fn`, return a new function that is identical to the original function except that it ensures `fn` is called at most once.

This Questions Improved my Problem Solving Skills in; 
1. Leveraging JavaScript's rest parameter for flexible function argument handling.
2. Utilizing closure to maintain state across function calls.
