üöÄ Day 10 of the #100DaysOfCode 

Today, I Solved 2 JavaScript DSA Questions on LeetCode.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Memoization Magic:
I tackled a fascinating problem involving memoization. By creating a memoized version of a function, I ensured that it never computes the same result twice for identical inputs. Utilizing JavaScript's Map data structure, I stored computed values and retrieved them efficiently. This optimization technique enhances the performance of functions, especially for repetitive computations.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Promise Pairing:
In another intriguing challenge, I mastered handling promises effectively. Given two promises resolving with numbers, I crafted a function to compute their sum asynchronously. Leveraging Promise.all, I synchronously awaited both promises to resolve, computed their sum, and returned a new promise with the result. This elegant solution showcases the power and simplicity of JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities.

This is what I Learned from these quesitons;

1. Memoization optimizes function performance by caching computed results.
2. Promises offer a streamlined approach to asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
3. Leveraging JavaScript's features creatively enhances problem-solving skills and code efficiency.

### About

The Currency Converter project is built with JavaScript and React, leveraging modern development tools like Vite for project setup and Tailwind CSS for styling. With a focus on usability and performance, this project offers a seamless experience for users to convert currencies effortlessly.

### Features

1. **Dynamic Currency Conversion**: Utilizing a custom hook, the Currency Converter fetches currency data from an API in real-time, allowing users to convert between various currencies with ease.
  
2. **Component Reusability**: Components are designed with reusability in mind, promoting modular code and enhancing maintainability.

3. **Optimized Performance**: Efforts are made to optimize performance, ensuring smooth interactions and minimizing unnecessary re-renders for an improved user experience.

Will be Optimizing, Updating & making it live in upcoming days.

# Day - 12

Continuing my JavaScript project - the Currency Converter! Today's wins:

1. useId Hook: Discovered this new React hook for generating unique IDs. These IDs are perfect for accessibility attributes, allowing users to navigate the form using the TAB key ‚Üπ.
2. Accessibility Boost: By using useId, I'm making the form more user-friendly for everyone!
3. Keys vs. useId: Learned a valuable distinction - useId is not for generating list keys. List keys should be derived from your data for optimal performance.
4. UI Upgrade: Added a background image to enhance the user experience!

Project Still needs Improvements so Will Upload snapshot later.

# Day - 13
